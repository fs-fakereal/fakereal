        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> April 5, 2025</p>

        <p>
            At <strong>Fake Real™</strong>, your privacy is important to us. This page outlines how we collect, use, and protect your data when you use our deepfake detection services, including the website, Chrome extension, and other affiliated tools.
        </p>

        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>
            Our system may collect the following types of data:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Uploaded Media:</strong> Images or videos submitted for deepfake analysis.</li>
            <li><strong>Metadata:</strong> Browser type, operating system, IP address, and timestamps.</li>
            <li><strong>User Credentials:</strong> Email and password for account login and optional profile data.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. How We Use Your Data</h2>
        <p>Your data is used to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Analyze uploaded media using our AI-based deepfake detection model.</li>
            <li>Improve detection accuracy through model retraining (anonymized data only).</li>
            <li>Provide account-related services and personalized experiences.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. AI Model Explanation</h2>
        <p>
            Fake Real™ uses a machine learning model trained on both real and fake media datasets. The model examines facial landmarks, motion inconsistencies, compression artifacts, and other subtle cues to determine the authenticity of an image or video.
        </p>
        <p>
            No facial recognition is performed or stored — the model focuses only on detecting manipulation patterns.
        </p>

        <h2>4. Data Retention & Deletion</h2>
        <p>
            Uploaded media is automatically deleted from our servers within 24 hours unless the user explicitly consents to retain it for research or feedback purposes.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can request to delete your account and associated data at any time by visiting the <strong>Profile</strong> page or contacting us directly.
        </p>

        <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>
            We do not sell or share user data with advertisers. However, certain services (e.g., image hosting, content delivery) may be managed by trusted partners under strict data protection agreements.
        </p>

        <h2>6. Security Measures</h2>
        <p>
            Your data is encrypted in transit and at rest. Access to your data is restricted to authorized personnel only. We implement regular audits and monitor systems for vulnerabilities.
        </p>

        <h2>7. User Rights</h2>
        <p>
            You have the right to access, modify, and delete your data. You also have the right to opt out of research participation and data tracking.
        </p>
